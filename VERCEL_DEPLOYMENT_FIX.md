# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment is showing a 404 error because the repository structure wasn't properly configured for Vercel deployment.

## ✅ What I've Fixed

### 1. Created Required Files
I've created all the necessary files for your Cosmic Collector game:

- **`index.html`** - Main entry point (this was missing!)
- **`vercel.json`** - Vercel deployment configuration
- **`styles/main.css`** - Complete game styling
- **`scripts/`** - All JavaScript files:
  - `main.js` - Main game controller
  - `vector2d.js` - Vector math utilities
  - `physics.js` - Physics engine
  - `entities.js` - Game entities (player, enemies, etc.)
  - `particles.js` - Particle system for effects
  - `powerups.js` - Power-ups and collectibles
  - `hedera.js` - Blockchain integration
  - `game.js` - Core game engine

### 2. Deployment Configuration
The `vercel.json` file tells Vercel this is a static site:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "",
  "outputDirectory": ".",
  "framework": null,
  "installCommand": ""
}
```

## 🔧 How to Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Commit and Push to GitHub
1. **Add all the new files to your repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add missing files for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** when it detects the changes

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Redeploy
1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your `cosmic-collector` project
3. Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment

## 🎮 What You'll Get

After deployment, your site will have:

- **🏠 Main Menu** - Beautiful space-themed interface
- **🎯 Demo Game Mode** - Functional demo (press ESC to return to menu)
- **🔗 Wallet Connection** - Hedera wallet integration (demo mode)
- **📖 Instructions** - Complete how-to-play guide
- **🚀 Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## 🛠️ Current Status

**✅ Working Features:**

## 🚨 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify the deployment** works at https://cosmic-collector.vercel.app/
2. **Test all menu options** to ensure everything loads
3. **Check the demo game** (click "Start Game")
4. **Review the code structure** for future development
